# Shopify App with PHP

**Part 1: Shopify**
1. Create a store on **Shopify Partner** account

2. Setup the development store (admin configuration, products, data etc.)
   We suggest to install **"Developer Tool"** from store admin to configure the store using dummy data.
   - https://developer-tools.shopifyapps.com/install
   
3. Now create a new **"App"** from Partner account to get "API_KEY" & "API_SECRET". Provide the Name & Redirec URL of your app.
   - Name           **My First App**
   - URL   **http://localhost/my-first-app/login.php**
